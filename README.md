# ReadYourFavoriteCitationStyleEverywhere
Cause it seems unnecessary someone else decides the style (are we still writing on paper, or what?)

Some things towards a solution:
- [identifier to Bibtex](https://doi-to-bibtex-converter.herokuapp.com/)
- [Pandoc](https://blog.esciencecenter.nl/why-all-youll-ever-need-is-markdown-dc604f0ab309)
- [citationJS](https://peerj.com/articles/cs-214/) sure is part of the solution(s). Look at it.
